# HyperTree Explorer

This project demonstrates a Decision Tree Classifier implemented with Scikit-Learn and visualized using Streamlit. It allows users to explore and visualize how different hyperparameters affect the performance of the Decision Tree model on a synthetic dataset.

##Demo

## Features

- **Interactive Parameter Selection**: Adjust hyperparameters like criterion, splitter, max depth, minimum samples split, minimum samples leaf, max features, max leaf nodes, and minimum impurity decrease using the Streamlit sidebar.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Visualize the decision boundary generated by the Decision Tree Classifier on a 2D synthetic dataset.
- **Graph Representation**: Display the structure of the trained Decision Tree using Graphviz.
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Compute and display the model's accuracy on the test data.

## How It Works

- **Dataset Generation**: A synthetic dataset with two features is created using the `make_moons` function from Scikit-Learn.
- **Model Training**: The Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the dataset based on the user-selected hyperparameters.
- **Visualization**: The decision boundary is visualized using a 2D mesh grid. The decision tree structure is displayed using Graphviz.
- **Performance Metrics**: The accuracy of the model is calculated and displayed after the model is trained.

## Parameters

- **Criterion**: The function to measure the quality of a split (`gini` or `entropy`).
- **Splitter**: The strategy used to choose the split at each node (`best` or `random`).
- **Max Depth**: The maximum depth of the tree.
- **Min Samples Split**: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.
- **Min Samples Leaf**: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.
- **Max Features**: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.
- **Max Leaf Nodes**: Grow a tree with the maximum number of leaf nodes.
- **Min Impurity Decrease**: A node will be split if this split induces a decrease in impurity greater than or equal to this value.
